/**
 * Automation ingest — shared vocabulary.
 *
 * Basecamp 10189985971 §3/§4. The one job of this file is to keep the *wire* vocabulary an SDK
 * sends separate from the *stored* vocabulary Tesbo's dashboards aggregate on, and to make the
 * translation between them explicit and total.
 *
 * This matters more than it looks. `executions.status` is a bare VARCHAR(32) and, until this
 * card, the single-result write path (`LegacyService.updateExecution`) validated nothing — so a
 * literal `"pass"` was stored verbatim and then counted as neither passed nor executed by every
 * aggregate in the product. The card's own draft contract in §6 specifies lowercase
 * `pass/fail/skip`, so an SDK written to the card would have corrupted every run it reported.

 * `LegacyService.EXECUTION_STATUSES`; anything not a key here is refused with the full list
 * rather than written.
 *
 * The two non-obvious mappings are Playwright's, and they are why this table exists rather than
 * a `capitalize()` call:
 *   - `timedout`    → Failed.  A test that ran out of time did not pass, and Tesbo has no
 *                     "timed out" status. Calling it Skipped (its nearest lexical neighbour)
 *                     would hide real failures from every pass-rate figure.
 *   - `interrupted` → Blocked. Playwright reports this when the *run* was torn down (another
 *                     test failed under --max-failures, or someone hit Ctrl-C), so the case never
 *                     reached a verdict of its own. Blocked is exactly that: not run, not the
 *                     case's fault. Recording Failed here would invent failures out of a
 *                     cancelled build.

/**
 * Evidence extensions accepted per kind.

 * NOT `LegacyService.KB_ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS`. That list deliberately excludes `zip` — "a zip hides
 * anything past an extension check" — and a Playwright trace is a `.zip`, so the card's §5
 * requirement to accept traces cannot be met by reusing it.
 *
 * The exception is narrow on purpose, and each clause below is load-bearing:
 *   - `zip` is accepted ONLY under kind 'trace', so a caller cannot smuggle one in as a
 *     screenshot;
 *   - the file is never opened, extracted or parsed server-side — it is an opaque blob stored
 *     and handed back for Playwright's trace viewer to open client-side;
 *   - it is served as a download, never inline, so nothing inside it is interpreted by a browser
 *     in Tesbo's origin;
 *   - the route requires a project-scoped API token or a project member, and the bytes are
 *     capped and billed against the workspace's plan meter exactly like every other upload.
 *
 * The residual risk is that a token holder can store up to EVIDENCE_MAX_FILE_SIZE of arbitrary
 * bytes in the workspace's own storage — which `.mp4` and `.webm` already allow. What the
 * original allowlist was protecting against was a *human* upload path where the extension is the
 * only signal of intent; that path is unchanged.
