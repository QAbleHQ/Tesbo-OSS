/**
 * Automation ingest — HTTP transport. Basecamp 10189985971 §6.
 *
 * **Why these paths and not the card's `/api/v1/runs/...`.** `ProjectWriteLockGuard` is registered
 * as a global APP_GUARD but matches only `^/api/projects/<uuid>(/.*)?$`, so mounting this surface
 * anywhere else would silently exempt automation from the plan read-only lock that every other
 * write path obeys — a behaviour decision made by accident of routing. Under
 * `/api/projects/:projectId/automation/...` a downgraded workspace refuses automation writes for
 * the same reason it refuses a manual edit, and the project is in the URL rather than the body so
 * the guard and the token scope check below can both see it.
 *
 * **Auth.** Either a browser session (a member of the project) or a project-scoped API bearer
 * token, resolved by AuthMiddleware. When a token is used it must be scoped to the project on the
 * URL and carry the right scope for the method — enforced here because
 * `LegacyService.requireProjectAccess` authorizes the token's *user*, who may belong to several
 * projects, so on its own it would let a token issued for project A write to project B. McpService
 * makes the same check for the same reason; the rest of the REST surface does not, which is a
 * wider gap recorded in docs/automation-integration-plan.md rather than fixed here.
