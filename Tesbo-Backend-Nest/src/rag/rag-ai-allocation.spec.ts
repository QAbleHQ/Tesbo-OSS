/*
 * Which key gets used to produce embeddings, and what we say when none can be.
 *
 * This is a unit test rather than e2e because the interesting cases are combinations of
 * workspace key state — an Anthropic chat key with a Gemini key sitting beside it, an inactive
 * allocation, an organization with nothing capable — and provisioning six workspaces through
 * the real API to assert on a resolution decision would be slow and would obscure the thing
 * being tested. The end-to-end proof that a resolved allocation actually retrieves a document
 * lives in e2e/api/knowledge-base.spec.ts.
 *
 * The regression these lock down: resolveEmbeddingAllocation used to accept only `openai` and
 * return a bare `null` for everything else. Every allocated key in production is Anthropic, so
 * it returned null for every project, and because null is also what "nothing relevant" looks
 * like, semantic search was off everywhere for months with no error, no alert and no log line.
