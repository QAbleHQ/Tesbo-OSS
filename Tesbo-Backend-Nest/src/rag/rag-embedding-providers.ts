 * same circular-dependency boundary rag-embedding.processor.ts documents (LegacyModule needs
 * RagIngestionService/RagRetrievalService, so nothing here may need anything back). Embedding
 * capability is also a RAG concern rather than a chat concern: it is about vector width and
 * index compatibility, not about how a chat request is shaped.
 *
 * The keys below MUST match PROVIDER_CATALOG's keys in legacy.service.ts. A provider absent
 * from this map is not an error — it means "this vendor has no embeddings endpoint", which is
 * the correct and permanent answer for Anthropic, Groq, DeepSeek, xAI and OpenRouter. Those
 * vendors serve chat only; a project using one for chat needs a second key for embeddings, and
 * that is normal rather than a misconfiguration. Nearly every production RAG stack built on
 * Claude pairs it with someone else's embeddings.
